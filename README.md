# CatTrap-Game

This was a game made in Grade 11, inspired by a popular game played in elementary school where school children would form a circle and hold tightly to a colorful parachute,
while a student on top of the parachute would act as the mouse and multiple students would hide beneath. The objective is to tag the mouse in as little tries as possible.
